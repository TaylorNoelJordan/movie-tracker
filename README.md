## Summary

Movie-Tracker is an application designed to show movies that are now playing in Theaters.  This app pulls from The Movie DB ABI (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for its movie information.  It also works with a local back-end server that keeps track of user data.  Users have the ability to create a new account, sign in and out of an existing account, and favor/unfavor/view previously favored movies as they wish- so long as the backend server is running.  This app is also equipped with proper error messaging, notifying a user if their email is already in use when creating a new account & if their email & password don't match when signing-in.
